Problem being addressed:

Today, conducting examinations for the visually impaired is replete with challenges. The
candidate has to avail the services of a scribe. Also, the question paper setter as well as the
answer script evaluator must be well versed in Braille. The proposed solution overcomes both
of these challenges, while ensuring that the visually impaired can still use Braille as a
medium of writing.


Proposed solution:

Developing a Braille based keyboard using which visually challenged students can take up
examinations. This keyboard would have buttons (equivalent to dots in the 3X2 braille
format) which would be mapped to the Braille language. The examination paper would be set
in English. A code would be written to covert this paper to Braille. In an examination centre,
a student would answer the question paper in Braille, using this keyboard. This would get
translated to English and be stored locally in the device. After the examination is completed,
the answers would be transmitted to a centralized database from which they can be read and
duly evaluated. This would eliminate the need for a scribe and ease the process of evaluation.


Workflow:

The workflow can be divided into 3 phases:
Phase 1: Setting the question paper
Traditionally, when the question paper for visually impaired candidates was to be set, the
paper setter had to be braille literate. However, a code to covert English to Braille would be
written. This would enable professors who are not well versed in Braille to set the paper. The
translated paper would now be printed using Braille printers which are widely available.
Phase 2: Examination
The Braille question paper generated in phase 1 would be handed out to the students at
designated examination centres. The student can read the questions and answer them in
Braille using the developed keyboard. A code would be written to map the Braille alphabet to
the English alphabet. This translated data would be stored locally in the device in a SD card
module. After the completion of the duration of the examination, the contents of the SD card
would be transmitted wirelessly to a central server using a Wi-Fi module.
Phase 3: Evaluating the answer scripts
The candidateâ€™s answer script would be retrieved from the central server and sent to the
relevant professor for evaluation. This document is in English and can hence be evaluated by
professors who are not literate in Braille as well.
